D:
    --check out D experimental allocators



library enhancements:
    --generic matrix library which should work with any slice(static + dynamic sizes)
    --jemalloc


voxel engine:
    --test umdc, choose between umdc, uniform cubical marching squares and uniform/adaptive blocky terrain
    --try implement uniform cubical marching squares as it might be the best fit for GPU
    --write(or find) .obj(or any other format that operates on triangles) to dense hermite grid converter

    --clean up GPU stuff


    --implement custom GPU noise using some really fast random noise backend ? Or even port FastNoise to GPU !
    --implement picking and on-the-fly terrain modification(without full reload)
