D:
    --check out D experimental allocators



library enhancements:
    --generic matrix library which should work with any slice(static + dynamic sizes)
    --jemalloc


voxel engine:
    --test umdc, choose between umdc, uniform cubical marching squares and uniform/adaptive blocky terrain
    --try implement uniform cubical marching squares as it might be the best fit for GPU
    --implement colorizer(f : Pos -> color) and render interesting terrain (sand,stone,ice,grass,etc..)
    --write(or find) .obj(or any other format that operates on triangles) to dense hermite grid converter

    --port uniform voxel storage sampling to GPU DONE
    --clean up GPU stuff

    --there is a bug somewhere: sometimes program crashs on extraction(umdc)
    --CPU noise looks very smooth and nice but GPU looks bad, why ?
