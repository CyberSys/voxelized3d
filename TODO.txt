D:
    --check out D experimental allocators



library enhancements:
    --generic matrix library which should work with any slice(static + dynamic sizes)



voxel engine:
    --test umdc, choose between umdc, uniform cubical marching squares and uniform/adaptive blocky terrain
    --try implement uniform cubical marching squares as it might be the best fit for GPU
    --implement colorizer(f : Pos -> color) and render interesting terrain (sand,stone,ice,grass,etc..)
    --write(or find) .obj(or any other format that operates on triangles) to dense hermite grid converter

    --basic idea and principle of hermite data format:
        we have n^3 uniform grid where n is number of cells along each axis
        1)we store (n+1)^3 density samples at corner points in one continuous array
        2)we store n^3 pointers (one for each cell). If the pointer in a cell is null then the cell is fully inside the closed surface on outside
           else the pointer should point to a region of memory where 3 continuous structs are located each containing
             zero-crossing point and normal
